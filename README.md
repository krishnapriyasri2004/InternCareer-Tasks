**Web Scraping and Automating Data Updates**

---

### Purpose of the Script:

The purpose of this Python script is to scrape data from the Flipkart search results page for 'iphone13', extract relevant information about iPhone models, clean and organize the data, save it to an Excel file, and automate the update process at specified intervals.

### Dependencies:

1. **BeautifulSoup:** Used for web scraping, it helps to pull data out of HTML and XML files.

   ```python
   from urllib.request import urlopen
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   ```

2. **Pandas:** A powerful data manipulation library, used for creating and manipulating data frames.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ```

3. **Requests:** Used for sending HTTP requests to the Flipkart website to retrieve HTML content.

   ```python
   import requests
   ```

4. **XlsxWriter:** A Python module for writing data and formatting information to Excel files.

   ```python
   pip install xlsxwriter
   ```

5. **Schedule:** A simple library to schedule periodic tasks.

   ```python
   pip install schedule
   ```

### How to Run in Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use the following commands to install them:

   ```python
   !pip install pandas
   !pip install xlsxwriter
   !pip install schedule
   ```

2. **Copy and Paste:**
   Copy the entire script and paste it into a Jupyter Notebook cell.

3. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the cell to run the script. This will initiate the web scraping, data cleaning, and organization process.

4. **View Output:**
   The script will print information about the scraping process and display the head of the resulting DataFrame. It will also save the raw and cleaned data to Excel files.

5. **Automation:**
   The script includes automation using the `schedule` library. It runs the scraping and data update process at regular intervals. Ensure that the script is kept running to enable automated updates.

### Document Structure:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   Import necessary libraries for web scraping, data manipulation, and automation.
