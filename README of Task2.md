Scripting and Data Preprocessing on Supermarket Sales Data with Automation ðŸ›’ðŸ“Š
Overview:
This repository showcases my work on scripting and data preprocessing tasks performed on a dataset related to supermarket sales. The main focus is on automating the data processing pipeline to enhance efficiency and reproducibility.

Highlights:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, converted date columns, and calculated derived features like "Total Cost."
Statistical Analysis: Computed summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations, including histograms, bar charts, and pair plots.
Data Filtering: Explored specific criteria to filter data based on product lines, sales amounts, and ratings.
Automation: Integrated automation to make the script versatile for different datasets.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
